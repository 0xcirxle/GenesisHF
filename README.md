# AI Hedge Fund Project

This project contains two subdirectories:

- `stylus-hedgefund/` – A Rust-based Stylus contract implementing the on-chain hedge fund.
- `hedgefund-cli/` – A CLI tool that interacts with the deployed contract, allowing deposits, withdrawals, rebalancing, etc.

See each subdirectory for more details on how to build and run.
